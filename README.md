# Stacked-Auto-Encoder


This is a python code using numpy and pandas and tenesor flow to implement stacked Auto-encoder neural network

*stacked autoencoder (SAE)* is a type of autoencoders (AE) is a neural network which is an unsupervised learning algorithm that are mainly used for dimensionality reduction, autoencoder comprised of two parts: encoder and decode, it encodes input in the hidden layer to a smaller dimension compared to the input dimension. Subsequently it decodes the hidden layer into an output.
